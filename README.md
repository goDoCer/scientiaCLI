# scientiaCLI

A command line interface for [scientia](https://scientia.doc.ic.ac.uk) for Imperial DoC students to download materials faster and easier.

## Installation

Right now we only support automatic Linux installation, but the code should work for Windows and MacOS.

### Linux

Clone this repo and run `sh install.sh`

### Windows/MacOS

Coming soon (Make an issue if you want this really quick)

## How to use

1. Login to Scientia. `scientia-cli login`
2. Create a directory to save all your files to `mkdir <save-directory>`
3. Download all the materials `scientia-cli download all`

To only download the materials for a particular course, say COMP40009 Computing Practical, run `scientia-cli download 4009`.
